# Community Science Museum Website

## Project Description
This project is a front-end website for the Community Science Museum, an interactive space designed to engage children (ages 7–15) and families with science in a fun and educational way.  

The goal is to design and build a responsive, user-friendly website that provides essential visitor information, highlights museum exhibits, and inspires families to visit in person. The design will use clear hierarchy, accessibility principles, and a visual style that appeals to both kids and parents.  

The project is developed as an individual assignment using semantic HTML and external CSS, following best practices in performance, SEO, and accessibility.

## Goals
- Create an engaging and child-friendly design that appeals to the target audience.  
- Build at least four pages: Home, Exhibits, Visit, About (plus optional Contact).  
- Apply compositional principles (typography, color, layout) for clarity and visual impact.  
- Use semantic, well-formatted HTML for structure.  
- Follow DRY principles in CSS for clean and reusable code.  
- Ensure the site is responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.  
- Optimize performance: images under 200kb and fast load times.  
- Implement WCAG accessibility standards (contrast, hierarchy, navigation).  
- Add basic SEO: meta tags, descriptive titles, alt text for images.  
- Document the development process in a short report: what went well and what could be improved.
